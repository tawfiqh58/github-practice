## System Design

This app usage `MongoDB` as primary database and `Redis` a cache database. Whenever a `user-event` happend like e.g. `create-user` with user data it will store it in the MongoDB database and then
fire an event-update method to automatically re-order and update dashboard status data to the Redis database and send a response to socket.io client who are listening for dashboard changes. But user who creates an account will not wait for this whole process rather he will get response immediately after storing data to MongoDB database. Thus the app will respond faster and also give real-time feature for the admin dashboard.
In a case if user request for data but Redis cache is empty then it
will fetch data from `MongoDB`, store it to the redis cache and then send response back to the user. This is a rare senario in this app but if this happend then the
request may take a while to get data from server but most of the time user will get data from Redis
cache.

## To run server

To start server first you need to install all the dependency

### `npm install`

then run this command to start the server!

### `npm run start`

<br/>

## To run next app

First go the react app directory by running this command

### `cd client`

then for the first time install all the dependency

### `npm install`

and then run this command to start your next app

### `npm run build`

### `npm run start`

## Q. How to create fake user?

Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send a `POST` request to your server
with your fake user count you want to generate.

### example

```
POST: http://localhost:5000/api/faker/generate

{
  "userCount": 1000000
}
```

To clean database after testing use the example below.

### example

```
POST: http://localhost:5000/api/faker/clean

{}
```
